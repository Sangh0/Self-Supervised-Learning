### Self-Supervised Learning?  
- SSL is proposed for utilizing unlabeled data  
- Labeling is so expensive with large dataset    
- SSL is widely used in representation learning to make a model learn the latent feature of the data  
- Recently, the performance of SSL has improved a lot compared to supervised learning method and the gap has closed
